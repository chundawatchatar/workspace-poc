# Remote access

## Database and email

`apps/server` uses Postgres for accounts and sends email over SMTP. For development, `compose.yaml` at the repo root
runs both locally: Postgres 17 and [Mailpit](https://mailpit.axllent.org/), an SMTP server that keeps every email in
a web inbox instead of delivering it. This setup is for developing this repo only, not for production.

1. Copy the settings once: `cp .env.example .env`. `.env` is gitignored. Change the dev password if you like, and
   keep `DATABASE_URL` in step with the `POSTGRES_*` values by hand, because nothing expands variables in it.
2. `bun run db:up` starts both services and returns once Postgres is healthy. It needs Docker with Compose v2.
3. `bun run db:down` stops them. The data stays in the `postgres-data` volume for the next `db:up`.

| Service | Address |
| --- | --- |
| Postgres | `127.0.0.1:5432`, the `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` |
| Mailpit SMTP | `127.0.0.1:1025`, the `SMTP_URL` in `.env` |
| Mailpit inbox | http://127.0.0.1:8025 |

Every port is published on `127.0.0.1` only, so nothing is reachable from the network.

To reset the database, remove the volume as well: `docker compose down -v`, then `bun run db:up`.

The server loads the root `.env` itself through `loadRootEnv()` from `@orch/shared/env`, however it is started.
Variables already set in the shell win over the file.
